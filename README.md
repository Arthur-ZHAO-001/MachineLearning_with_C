# MachineLearning with C

### 1.Instructions

Those codes are written in the form of a complete C language project, and the uploaded file is the code that implements the algorithm. Each of these folders contains header files and C files. Because some of the same functions are used when implementing different algorithms, there are mutual references between files. During the implementation process, no third-party libraries were used except the C language standard library. And the algorithm can be applied to different data sets. All codes have detailed comments.




### 2.Algorithm

1. **Sample Linear Regression**
2. **Multivariate Linear Regression**
3. **Perceptron**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors**
5. **Naive Bayes**
6. **Learning Vector Quantization**
